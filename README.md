### Elevetor Script with OX_LIB

### Information
This Script was originally made by Nyx Development, he published it under the MIT License.
He made it for qbcore only and when people asked to make it for ESX (what takes legit no time) he responded by telling the people to buy the V2 Elevator from Tebex.
So here is my oxlib fork.
